# E-Commerce_Admin-Panel
An admin panel for an e_commerce website.

This is mainly a backend focussed project. Multiple validations for admin signup/ login has been implemented. Data addition and updation can be done without page reload. This is achieved using AJAX. PHP is the main backend language used for this project.

Image rendering without page reload and image updation using valid url is implemented. The hallmark of this project is pagination. For querying of the database MySQL is the language used. For all the logical aspects, JS has been used.

Data search functionality is implemented using MySQL. A simple admin dashboard is also present for getting the basic summary of contents of the database.

The three main pages of this project are products, categories and the list of admins.

As this is a backend foccused project, session handling is also done. No page can be accessed without signing in, be it in localhost or hosted server. Also care has been taken that no admin can be made directly. Only an existing admin can add a new admin.
